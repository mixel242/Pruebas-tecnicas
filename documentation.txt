Challenge:

### Web Site:

Write a test for the website: [https://www.kiwibot.com/](https://www.kiwibot.com/) the test should verify if the QA Engineer position is open starting from the home page and filtering by remote jobs in the careers section, then subscribe to the newsletter.

### Web Service:

Read our **API** documentation [https://kiwihub.readme.io/v2.9.2](https://kiwihub.readme.io/v2.9.2/reference/overview) and crate test for the following endpoints:

- Create Quote
- Create Delivery
- Get Delivery

API KEY: `AIzaSyBoeZKquQlbxUzwzQLg_-pePYVZg6gT6IY`

REQUESTER ID: `3e77f61f-c434-4fb9-94d9-1699f5a1c14b`

### Also:

- Please list the tools that you know to automate tests
- Please list the platforms that you know that can help to do a very good QA

#Description:

An automated test was developed on the Kiwibot.com website using Cypress V10.70.0 in which a flow was sought to verify if the QA engineer position was open and then subscribe to the news letter

On the other hand, the creation of an automated test was requested on the API used by kiwibot on 3 endpoints - Create Quote - Create Delivery - Get Delivery

#Extra requests:
- list the tools that you know to automate tests
- list the platforms that you know that can help to do a very good QA

***** start command: npm run cypress:open

NOTE: I was only able to develop the automated test of the API using Cypress since the use of cy.request is not yet fully handled, so I still cannot provide a test of the expected quality, I am studying and preparing myself to achieve the best result
